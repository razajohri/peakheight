# Development Rules

## Code Implementation Rule

**"Don't write any code until you're very confident (95% or more) in what needs to be done. If unclear, ask for more info."**

### Why This Rule Matters

This rule ensures:
- **Code Quality**: Higher confidence leads to better, more accurate implementations
- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary rework and debugging
- **Problem Solving**: Ensures we're solving the right problem before writing code
- **Requirements Clarity**: Forces clear understanding of what needs to be built

### How to Apply

1. **Gather Requirements**: Understand exactly what needs to be implemented
2. **Ask Questions**: If anything is unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Plan First**: Think through the solution before writing any code
4. **95% Confidence**: Only proceed when you're very confident in the approach
5. **Document Decisions**: Write down your understanding to confirm clarity

### Examples of When to Ask for More Info

- Unclear user requirements
- Ambiguous technical specifications
- Multiple possible implementation approaches
- Integration points with other systems
- Performance or scalability requirements
- Error handling expectations
