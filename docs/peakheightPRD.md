- project's overview:
1. Introduction
PeakTall addresses a unique but widespread challenge: most health apps ignore the desire to maximize natural height. Many teens and young adults want to reach their full height potential but lack science-backed guidance, daily routines, and motivation. PeakTall’s vision is to become the go-to mobile app for height optimization—using AI, habit tracking, and gamification to help users grow as tall as their genetics allow.
